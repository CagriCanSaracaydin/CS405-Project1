# CS405-Project1

## Project Overview

This project is a WebGL-based 3D cube rendering application. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of WebGL for rendering 3D objects and applying various transformations to them.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on example of using WebGL to render 3D objects and apply transformations such as translation, scaling, and rotation. This project can be used as a learning resource for understanding the basics of WebGL and 3D graphics programming.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/CagriCanSaracaydin/CS405-Project1.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd CS405-Project1
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the 3D cube rendering.

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The 3D cube will be rendered on the canvas.
3. The cube will animate with periodic transformations, transitioning between its initial position and a target position every 10 seconds.

## Examples

Here is an example of the 3D cube rendering:
